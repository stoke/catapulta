A REST-ly API to interface with [Xmage](https://github.com/magefree/mage) servers

Motivations
---

I feel Xmage is seriously the best project out there if you like to play MTG but you don't have the money to afford the crazy MTGO market.

However, Xmage uses old technologies like Swing for its client, and let's be honest: it sucks.

I think that this API could be the first step in a better (maybe web-based?) client, and portability over more devices (android?)

Do you need help? - Where is doc?

Yes, I do. And there isn't one right now.

ATM there aren't any tests (i'm still trying to test if this is viable in a cool way), if you want to help or try APIs out just open an issue or send me an email and i'll be more than happy to give you my best help.
